## Final Project


## Aim of the Project 
The goal and objective of this project is to develop a face mask detector which would easily identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not. 
This will keep a check on people not wearing masks and in return will help ensure public safety.

The problem that I am trying to address is lack of awareness among people ofnot wearing a mask during the COVID pandemic. 
People who are not wearing masks should be banned from entering public spaces and this project aims at identifying the ones wearing a mask from the ones who are not.
